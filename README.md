# 📦 PyBox

**PyBox** is a secure, lightweight file storage and sharing platform inspired by Dropbox — built to demonstrate robust backend development and Python proficiency.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

PyBox is my ongoing quest to build a secure, scalable, and privacy-focused alternative to mainstream file-sharing tools. The core idea is to let users:

- 📁 Upload personal files
- 🔗 Share access via secure links (if they choose)
- 🔒 Ensure strong file privacy and communication security

While the project is still under development, it’s designed to be a practical showcase of my backend development skills using modern Python tooling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **🧠 FastAPI** – High-performance backend framework
- **🐍 Python** – Core language powering the system
- **📄 Logging** – Integrated logger system to track file uploads, access, and internal events
- *(More technologies and enhancements coming soon as the project evolves)*

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Build a Dropbox-style file management system
- ✅ Enable secure, link-based file sharing
- ✅ Provide a clean and simple web interface (coming soon)
- 🛡️ Focus on privacy-first communication
- 🧩 Explore modular file management and real-time sync features in future phases

## 👨‍💻 Developer's Note

This project is not only about building a tool — it's my way of showing that I’m proficient in Python, know how to architect secure and modular systems, and am passionate about turning complex ideas into real applications.

**Stay tuned — there’s more to come.**

## 📌 Status

🚧 **Under Active Development**

I’m actively building features, polishing the interface, and working toward making PyBox production-ready.
