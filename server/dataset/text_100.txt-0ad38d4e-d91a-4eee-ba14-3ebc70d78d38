Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world in numerous ways, from self-driving cars to personalized recommendations. AI systems rely on large datasets and complex algorithms to make predictions and decisions. The applications of AI span across industries including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. As machine learning models improve, the demand for explainability and fairness in AI grows. Developers are now focusing on building transparent systems that align with ethical guidelines. The evolution of AI tools has also empowered non-experts to build intelligent applications. With libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, building machine learning models has become more accessible than ever.
